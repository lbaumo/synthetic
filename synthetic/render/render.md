Galsim backend
==============
to render a catalog line of sight into an observed image canvas


Preparing to run
-----------------

Start by installing galsim https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim

It's fine to do this install in a separate conda environment.
Let's make that as 

    conda create -n galsim python=3

which you should activate by `conda activate galsim`

Intall the actual galsim package by

    conda install -c conda-forge galsim

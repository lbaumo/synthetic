# SYNTHETIC

1) This package generates synthetic images of optical galaxy cluster observations.
2) It also provides tools for reducing and processing synthetic images with metacalibration to obtain the input shear field.
These 
3) Provide an end-to-end method validation environment for numerical methods in weak lensing measurements of galaxy clusters 

The setup of the package is aimed to be representative of the data analysis setup of the Dark Energy Science Consorcium (DESC) of the Legace Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

### Synthetic data is:
    
 * artificially generated data
 * trained to be representative of the real scenario
 * used to test and evaluate algorithms, models, and software pipelines.
 
### Scientific scope

In the domain of galaxy cluster observations our aim is to measure the weak gravitational lensing signal induced by
the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters, which enables us to estimate their masses. 
Validating and calibrating the the weak lensing measurement is revealed to be an involved task, and the aim of this package is to 
provide the synthetic data which is then used for testing, benchmarking statistical estimators and software pipelines.

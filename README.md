# SYNTHETIC

This package provides tools for generating synthetic images about optical galaxy cluster observations 
aimed at the Dark Energy Science Consorcium (DESC) of the Legace Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
Synthetic data is artificially generated data that is used to test and evaluate algorithms, models, and software pipelines.
In the domain of galaxy cluster observations our aim is to measure the weak gravitational lensing signal induced by
the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters, which enables us to estimate their masses. 
Validating and calibrating the the weak lensing measurement is revealed to be an involved task, and the aim of this package is to 
provide the synthetic data which is then used for testing, benchmarking statistical estimators and software pipelines.

Some illustrations of earlier publication in our team is provided at the following [link](https://vargatn.github.io/synthetic/)

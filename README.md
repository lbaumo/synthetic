# synthetic
Synthetic galaxy cluster images and catalogs for optical sky surveys


# Project outline

**Phase A** Implement custom galsim backend

in progress,

Tasks
  * reproduce DES pipeline, 
  * LSST PSF and instrument simulator, check what is this really



**Phase B** Define settings pipeline for DES / Rubin / Euclid - style runs in a comprehendable way

**Phase C** Keep a design doc

**Phase D** Submit a sequential set of iterations of clusters

**Phase C** Replace galsim galaxies with cGAN-ned galaxies from David

**Phase D** lightweight render for web wiever "infinite sky"

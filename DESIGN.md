# Vision

The aim of this package is to bring synthetic image based end to end
image simulations and shear estimations down to earth. 

Make it accessible to a master / grad student level of competency

This will enable a smoother start for grad student, and swifter 
onboarding for more experienced researchers

# Outline

The main stages of this work are

1) Training a model to generate synthetic galaxy cluster catalogs
2) Ine

# Vision

The aim of this package is to bring synthetic image based end to end
image simulations and shear estimations down to earth. 

Make it accessible to a master / grad student level of competency

This will enable a smoother start for grad student, and swifter 
onboarding for more experienced researchers

# Outline

The main stages of this work are

1) Training a model to generate synthetic galaxy cluster catalogs
2) Ine

# Project outline

**Phase A** Implement custom galsim backend

in progress,

Tasks
  * reproduce DES pipeline, 
  * LSST PSF and instrument simulator, check what is this really



**Phase B** Define settings pipeline for DES / Rubin / Euclid - style runs in a comprehendable way

**Phase C** Keep a design doc

**Phase D** Submit a sequential set of iterations of clusters

**Phase C** Replace galsim galaxies with cGAN-ned galaxies from David

**Phase D** lightweight render for web wiever "infinite sky"

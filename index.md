# Synthetic survey-like galaxy cluster observations

We aim to create a full synthetic testbed for **cluster weak lensing measurements**. 

## What's the point? 
The interplay between different observational and systematic effects can be best characterized in a unified benchmark which tests the measurement in an
end-to-end fashion from mock observations to recovered cluster masses. Constructing such mocks which capture the key observational and physical properties of galaxy clusters very much non-trivial.  

## What's the method?
Develop a statistical learning model using a data driven approach to measure the photometric properties of
galaxy clusters and their sky-environments. In turn this model is then used to generate
plausible mock galaxy clusters and model their line-of-sights in a way which captures the
real distribution of galaxies and their observed photometric features. 


## Future Outlook
This work hence sets the ground for a dedicated cluster image simulation analysis estimating the performance
of past and upcoming cluster mass calibration measurements.

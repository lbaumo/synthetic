# How to access data for the part A of the tutorial

The training data extracted from the LSST DC2 simulations is too big to be included in the git repository

At the moment the key files are accessed from the following google drive links:

[clust_dc2-sim-LOS_v1.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zzm7PJm96xvtxfb1xqkip4w9SjVPV84J/view?usp=share_link)

[cosmoDC2_v1.1.4_refpixels.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v6k1V4kaDFfLE-qgWQbQ54x2D3BYCA5J/view?usp=share_link)

[dc2-alpha_concentric_sample-v01_test-03.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v6k1V4kaDFfLE-qgWQbQ54x2D3BYCA5J/view?usp=share_link)

Alternatively the same files can be produced via notebooks A0, A1 and A2
